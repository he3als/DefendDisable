# Defend Disable ✖️
A batch script to disable Windows Defender. This script allows you to disable or enable Windows Defender along with its services and drivers. **Only use this if you really know what you are doing, security will be worsened.** SmartScreen is also disabled. This disables the actual Windows Defender drivers and services, so services like Antimalware Service Executable are not even running in the background taking up resources, unlike if you disabled it through the Security app.

**You need tamper protection disabled before running this script! You won't be able to enable Defender on systems with Defender stripped/removed.**

**Download:** https://github.com/he3als/DefendDisable/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

**Usage:** Simply extract the `.zip` file into a folder and double click on the 'DisableDefend.cmd' file.
